Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI can be divided into narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and general AI, which aims to perform any intellectual task a human can. Machine learning, a subset of AI, involves training algorithms on data to improve their performance over time. Deep learning, a further subset, uses neural networks with many layers to analyze complex data patterns. AI applications span various fields, from healthcare, where it aids in diagnostics, to finance, where it helps in fraud detection. Autonomous vehicles, powered by AI, are transforming transportation. However, AI also raises ethical concerns, such as job displacement and privacy issues. Ongoing research aims to make AI systems more robust, transparent, and aligned with human values.
